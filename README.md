amalgamate - a template library for javascript
--------------------------------------------

Run benchmarks: `coffee bench.coffee`
Run tests: `grunt nodeunit`

What's left to be done:

- lots of features need added (partials, helpers, inheritance, etc).
- browser based template examples/try-it-out tool.
- browser benchmark support.
- fixes to highly flawed benchmarks.
